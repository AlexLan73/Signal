## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a signal analysis engineer, I want to use a desktop application with a modern interface to analyze mathematical signals, generate data according to mathematical laws, visualize results in 2D, 3D, and spectral formats, and persist my analysis data in a database, so that I can efficiently conduct signal processing research and maintain historical analysis records.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application is launched, **When** I configure signal parameters, **Then** I can generate mathematical signals and see them displayed in real-time
2. **Given** I have generated signal data, **When** I switch between different visualization windows, **Then** the transition is smooth and data context is preserved
3. **Given** I want to analyze signal spectrum, **When** I select spectral analysis mode, **Then** I can view harmonic components and envelope analysis over time
4. **Given** I have analysis results, **When** I save the session, **Then** all data, parameters, and visualizations are persisted to the database
5. **Given** I have a database connection, **When** I query historical data, **Then** I can retrieve and analyze previous signal processing sessions

### Edge Cases
- What happens when database connection is lost during data generation?
- How does system handle large datasets that exceed available memory?
- What occurs when switching between visualization modes with incompatible data formats?
- How does the system handle real-time data updates when the user is interacting with controls?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a modern, responsive desktop interface with smooth window transitions
- **FR-002**: System MUST implement observer pattern for real-time data updates across multiple visualization components

- **FR-004**: System MUST support database connectivity to PostgreSQL or SQLite (user-selectable, no database required at startup)
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate mathematical signals based on configurable mathematical laws and parameters
- **FR-006**: System MUST display signals in multiple visualization formats: 2D plots, 3D surfaces, and spectral analysis
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide real-time spectral analysis showing harmonic components over time
- **FR-008**: System MUST support envelope analysis for signal processing applications
- **FR-009**: System MUST persist signal data, analysis parameters, and visualization states to database
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow retrieval and restoration of previous analysis sessions from database
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate mathematical input parameters and handle invalid configurations gracefully
- **FR-012**: System MUST achieve maximum calculation and visualization speed using GPU acceleration

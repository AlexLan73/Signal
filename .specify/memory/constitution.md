# SignalAnalyzer Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Desktop-First Architecture
SignalAnalyzer is designed as a native desktop application using PyQt6 for optimal performance with mathematical computations and real-time graphics. The application prioritizes responsiveness, low latency, and full system resource utilization over web-based alternatives.

### II. Mathematical Accuracy & Performance
All mathematical operations must use numpy/pandas for vectorized computations, achieving sub-millisecond response times for signal generation and real-time plotting. Mathematical models are implemented using scipy/sympy for scientific precision.

### III. Modular Component Design
Each functional component (2D plots, 3D visualization, oscilloscope, data generator) must be implemented as independent, testable modules with clear interfaces. Components communicate through well-defined data contracts.

### IV. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory for all mathematical functions, GUI interactions, and data processing pipelines. Tests must validate numerical accuracy, GUI responsiveness, and memory efficiency. Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced.

### V. Real-Time Performance Standards
Oscilloscope and animated plots must maintain 60+ FPS with configurable buffer sizes. Memory usage must remain stable during extended operation. All GUI operations must complete within 16ms (60 FPS threshold).

## Technology Stack Requirements

### GUI Framework
- **Primary**: PyQt6 for native desktop performance
- **Alternative**: Kivy for cross-platform compatibility if needed
- **Widgets**: Custom widgets for signal visualization and controls

### Graphics & Visualization
- **2D Plotting**: matplotlib with PyQt integration for static plots
- **Real-time Graphics**: pyqtgraph for oscilloscope and animated plots
- **3D Visualization**: PyOpenGL for complex 3D surfaces and volumes
- **Performance**: Hardware acceleration where available

### Data Processing
- **Numerical Computing**: numpy for vectorized operations
- **Data Analysis**: pandas for structured data manipulation
- **Scientific Computing**: scipy for signal processing algorithms
- **Symbolic Math**: sympy for equation modeling and validation

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality Standards
- All mathematical functions must include unit tests with known test vectors
- GUI components must be tested for responsiveness and memory leaks
- Performance benchmarks required for critical paths (signal generation, plotting)
- Code coverage minimum: 85% for mathematical modules, 70% for GUI components

### Architecture Guidelines
- Separate concerns: GUI logic, mathematical computations, and data I/O
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Implement observer pattern for real-time data updates
- Memory management: explicit cleanup for large datasets and graphics objects

### Testing Framework
- **Unit Tests**: pytest for mathematical functions and data processing
- **GUI Tests**: pytest-qt for PyQt6 component testing
- **Performance Tests**: Custom benchmarks for real-time requirements
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflows from data generation to visualization

## Governance

SignalAnalyzer Constitution supersedes all other development practices. Amendments require:
1. Performance impact analysis for any architectural changes
2. Mathematical accuracy validation for algorithm modifications
3. User experience impact assessment for GUI changes
4. Migration plan for backward compatibility

All code reviews must verify compliance with performance standards and mathematical accuracy. Complexity must be justified with measurable performance benefits.
